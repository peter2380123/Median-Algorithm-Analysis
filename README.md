## Focus
This project was to conduct empirical and theoretical analysis of two median-finding algorithm.
Although they may serve the same purpose, by performing algorithm analysis we can further demonstrate how efficiency and time complexity can be drastically different.

## Results
Comparing number of operations:

Comparing execution time:

Demonstrating linearity by plotting no. of operations with execution time:

It is therefore concluded that the brute-force algorithm is of O(n^2) efficiency whereas quick-median is O(n).
